;;; lint381.el --- style check your code according to EECS381 style guidelines

;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows you to filter code through lint381 to warn you about
;; potential violations of the EECS 381 style guidelines. This is done through
;; flycheck, so if you don't have that installed, get to that first.
;; see https://github.com/arxanas/lint381,
;;     http://www.umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/C_Coding_Standards.pdf,
;; and http://www.umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/C++_Coding_Standards.pdf

;; Ensure the directory of this file is in your `load-path' and add
;;
;;   (require 'lint381)
;;
;; to your .emacs configuration.

;; you will likely want to add a c-mode hook in which you define the language
;; used to be c. The following should suffice:
;;
;; (setq flycheck-lint381-language "c")

;;; Notes:

;; The writer of this file assumes that if you're using this, you're
;; probably also using cppcheck. If this is not the case, you will need
;; to add some further config. The following should work:

;; ; replace <checker> with whatever you're using. If you're only doing
;; ; compilation checks it will likely be c/c++-clang or c/c++-gcc. If you're
;; ; doing any sort of further static analyis, it's probably best to use that.
